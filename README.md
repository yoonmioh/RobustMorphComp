This repo contains Supplementary Informaton for the paper "Towards robust complexity indices in linguistic typology: a corpus-based assessment".

- `data.txt`: the txt file providing most of the information for each language 
- `dataMC.txt`: the values of four morphological complexity metrics (WID, TTR, MTLD, H) obtained by different corpus sampling configurations (Whole, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 subsets)
- `allWID.txt`: the average WID estimated from three different corpus configurations (WID_FP, WID_PP, and WID_NP)
- `Figure 1.png`: the image file for Figure 1 not generated by R code 
- `Figure 12.png`: the image file for Figure 12 not generated by R code 
- `surprisal.txt`: English surprisal estimated at the verse level with the lm-scorer package downloaded from https://github.com/simonepri/lm-scorer using the GPT-2 model
- `WID_PP_NP.txt`: WID_PP and WID_NP calculated with randomized English surprisal
- `rWID_PP_NP.txt`: Spearman's correlation coefficient between WID_PP and WID_NP
- `SupplementaryInfo.Rmd`: the RMarkdown file incorporating the analysis code, the main results detailed in the paper and results from additional analyses
- `SupplementaryInfo.html`: the resulting HTML file
